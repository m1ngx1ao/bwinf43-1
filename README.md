This is my solution to the [first round](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/43/#c4046) of the 43nd [Bundeswettbewerb Informatik](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/).

As this competition is held in German, the word documentation is also written in Germany. Perhaps google translate might help you out here... But at least the source code and the mark down are in English now.
